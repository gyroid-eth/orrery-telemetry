# AgentStack mail extraction

`agentstack-mail` is developed inside this repository as a logically isolated
package first. Repository extraction is deliberately deferred until the
versioned contract, independent export/test gate, install/upgrade/rollback
manifest, and N/N-1 consumer tests are stable.

The authoritative implementation input is the working live Python AgentMail
checkout, including its local commits and dirty signal/runtime fixes. Current
upstream is retained only as an advisory security and bug-fix source.

The development endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:18765`; data lives below
`~/.agentstack/mail`. Existing AgentMail remains on its own endpoint and data
roots throughout development. No test or installer may point both services at
one writable database or archive.

The caller-derived compatibility surface is versioned in
`packages/agentstack_mail/fixtures/compatibility-tools-v1.json`. Its 22 tools
are the positive union of executable callers and shipped model-facing
contracts. Permission deny entries, negative instructions, and Codex
Bridge-local operations do not become source-extraction roots.

The first implementation train is:

1. freeze provenance, live tool schemas, and the caller-derived tool contract;
2. define isolated configuration and an exact-schema database copy/import gate;
3. port identity, messaging/contact, receipt, reservation, and notification
   behavior with differential tests against the live source;
4. port HTTP and lifecycle stability without the machine-specific notify and
   tmux daemons;
5. update installer, doctor, bridge, hooks, skills, and permissions atomically
   to the new MCP key;
6. run coexistence, migration, rollback, fault, and real-machine soak gates
   before any authority switch.

The old `mcp-agent-mail` MCP key is not registered as an alias by default,
because doing so would recreate the collision this package is intended to
remove. Existing record compatibility is a data/schema requirement, separate
from tool-prefix compatibility.
